## Plans for learning

On our project we are planning to use the MERN stack which consists of:
- MangoDB
- Express
- React
- Node

We plan on watching tutorials and read articles about the tecnologies we want to learn about
We also plan on having members of the team that are more familiar with certain parts of the stack help other teammates that might not be so familiar with it

## Learning Trajectories
- Yash commits to work through a tutorial of Introductory React during week 3 and a tutorial of React states and React components during week 4
- Zach commits to learning more about React custom hooks, and understanding how to integrate MongoDB into the front end so that we can get a functional MVP that saves state. In week 3, Zach will work on setting up MongoDB, and in week 4 Zach will work on learning to integrate hooks.
- Justin commits to read and watch tutorials to learn more about frontend implementation during week 3 and then read and watch tutorials to better understand backend development during week 4
- Nathan commits to watch more tutorials for react during week 3 and read the documentations for frontend development during week 4 to implement nice quality of life functions to make the quarter calendar easier to use.
- Matt commits to learn more about react and node integration by watching tutorials during week 3 and for week 4 I plan to learn about how to deploy the full solution on the web by reading articles about the matter

## Participation on the forums
- Matt asked a question on the React Forum:I had a question, as far as deploying a react page I know how to do it, but how do you deploy both the front and backend and connect them to work together in a website like render for example?
- Yash Posted a video that talks over a component: https://youtu.be/fYq5PXgSsbE this is a good video on how to create a flexbox in html +Js + css
