# Date of Retrospective: 03/10/23
* Led by: Madison Long
* Present: Christian, Justin, Madison, Matt, Yash,
* Absent: Nathan
## Action item
* Start:
We want to make more effective use of the daily scrum.
* a change:
We want to prioritize documentation and communication in the final stretch
* a measurement:
The number of days each week we all send a message and document our visual changes for comparison.
## Retro Assessment
* A brief description of what retro outline or process you used:
We used the stop/start/continue template for this retro meeting.
* A brief assessment of how it went:
Overall, very well, we drew up our responses on slack and discussed them. Unlike the previous retros, there is very little time left in the quarter and any new items we want to start will have a very limited implementation window. In the final stretch I feel as if we are on the same page about what we need to do and how we want to do it.
* What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro
  based on what you learned today?
Give everyone a chance to speak. Always list any criticism or requests in a positive way. Also donâ€™t forget to provide your own feedback as well as listening to the feedback of others.
