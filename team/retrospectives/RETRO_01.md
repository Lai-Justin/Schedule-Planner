# Date of Retrospective: 01/27/23

* Led by: Zach
* Present: Christian, Justin, Madison, Matt, Nathan, Yash, Zach
* Absent: None

## Action item

* a goal:
We want to make more effective use of the daily scrum.

* a change: 
We want to make each memebr more active during the daily scrum and be daily active on slack.

* a measurement:
How much more documentation we have on the daily scrum notes, a message each day from each member giving project updates, especially on dates we are not meeting in person.

## Retro Assessment

* A brief description of what retro outline or process you used:
We used the stop/start/continue template for our retro meeting.

* A brief assessment of how it went:
It went well, I found an online source where we could anonymously answer the three questions, and then we reviewed the questions all together. Since the answers were all anonymous, I was also able to effectively participate as the retro leader.

* What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro
  based on what you learned today?
Make sure to leave room for people to bring up their own issues, and give solution/potential improvements the team could make. Conversely, don't make any one person responsible for a team problem, if one exists.
