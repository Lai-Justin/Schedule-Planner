Short stories often show how moments that might appear very ordinary to most of us can in fact be momentous, utterly transformative, for somebod y.  In this, for modern, humdrum, everyday lives, they can provide a kind o f modernist sublime.

We read criti cal discussions of trauma (especially neuro-biological and psychoanalytic) and literary texts that deal with trauma. Some of the questions we explore are the relation between individual and collective experiences of trauma; s omatic and psychological consequences of trauma; how trauma impedes learnin g and well-being; the benefits and harms of trigger warnings; responsible w ays to speak and write about trauma.",

Accordingly, this course emphasizes the contacts, int erchanges, and conflicts between the different groups that inhabited the At lantic World, offering new insights into the cultural, social, political, a nd economic processes that transformed the early Americas between 1400 and 1800 and laid the groundwork for contemporary American society.",

For example, estrogen rece ptors are found throughout the entire brain, which hints at the powerful ro le this hormone plays in shaping brain function and, ultimately, behavior.
